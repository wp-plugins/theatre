Build a website for your theater, music venue, sports team, cinema or your rockband! Add upcoming events and ticketing to your WordPress website. 

== Description ==
A WordPress plugin to manage events with all necessary shortcodes and widgets for your theater.

__Shortcodes__

Theater comes with several shortcodes and widgets to show off your events. See the [documentation](https://github.com/slimndap/wp-theatre/wiki/Shortcodes) for an overview.

== Installation ==

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.

1. Install the plugin.
1. Start adding your productions and events using the Theater-menu or the Theater dashboard widget.

__Productions and events__

Theater uses _productions_ to group your _events_. 

Each production has it's own page and can have one or more events. 

Events don't have their own pages. They only appear on pages with event listings.

So if you run a theater then 'The Sound Of Music' is a _production_ and the show this weekend is an _event_.

If you are a musician then your band is a _production_ and your gigs are the _events_.

For a sports club your teams are the _productions_ and the games are the _events_.


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

__All event listings look really weird!__

Make sure that you checked the 'Enable built-in Theater stylesheet'-option in the Theater plugin settings.

__I don't see the Theater Calendar widget__

Make sure that you select a page to show your event listings on in the Theater plugin settings.

__I really need feature X. Can you add it?__

If you are missing a feature that you really need for your website you can:

1. submit a feature request on the [forum](http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/theatre) or
1. add it yourself and submit a pull request on [GitHub](https://github.com/slimndap/wp-theatre) or
1. [hire me](mailto:jeroen@slimndap.com).

The new feature may be added directly to the Theater plugin or as an extension so that others may benefit from this as well.

== Changelog ==

= 0.10 =

Release Date: December 29th, 2014

* Bugfixes
    * Changed priority of some `save_post`-hooks to avoid conflicts with ACF's `save_post`-hooks. Thanks [paramir](https://github.com/paramir)!
    * Fixed some PHP warnings.

* Enhancements
    * Event listings can be paginated or grouped by year: `[wpt_events paginateby=year]` or `[wpt_events groupby=year]`.
    * Better support for past events. You can now create historic event listings paginated or grouped by day, month, year or category.
    * You can change the order of events and production in listings: `[wpt_events order=desc]` or `[wpt_productions order=desc]`.

* Experimental
    * A new WPT_Importer class to easily create your own import for your ticketing system. Still a work in progress. Play with it, but don't use it on your production website. Always make backups!

* Added support for start and end dates in `[wpt_events]` shortcode. You can throw anything at it that strtotime understands! Some examples:
    * `[wpt_events start="now"]`

    * `[wpt_events start="2014-09-02"]`
    * `[wpt_events end="now"]`
    * `[wpt_events start="2014-09-01" end="2014-10-01"]`
    * `[wpt_events start="now" end="+1 week"]`
    * `[wpt_events start="next Monday" end="next Monday +1 week"]`
* Removed WordPress SEO by Yoast meta box from event admin screens.
* Improved category filtering for production and event listings. You can now use `cat`, `category_name`, `category__and`, `category__in` and `category__not_in` attributes in the `[wpt_events]` and `[wpt_productions]` shortcodes.
* Added productions filtering for production listings. You now use `post__in` and `post__not_in` attributes in the `[wpt_productions]` shortcode.
