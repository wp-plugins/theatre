Add event listings to your Wordpress website. Build a website for your theater, music venue, museum, conference center or you rockband!

== Description ==

== Installation ==

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.

1. Install the plugin.
1. Start adding your productions and events using the Theatre-menu or the Theatre dashboard widget.

__Productions and events__

Theatre uses _productions_ to group your _events_. 

Each production has it's own page and can have one or more events. 

Events don't have their own pages. They only appear on pages with event listings.

So if you run a theatre then 'The Sound Of Music' is a _production_ and the show this weekend is an _event_.

If you're a musician then your band is a _production_ and your gigs are the _events_.

__Widgets__

Theater comes with one widget. Place it in your sidebar to show a list of all upcoming events.

__Shortcodes__

Theatre comes with one shortcode:

	[wp_theatre_events]
 
Add it to the content of your post or page to show a list of all upcoming events.

You can also add header above the listing:

	[wp_theatre_events]Upcoming events[/wp_theatre_events]
