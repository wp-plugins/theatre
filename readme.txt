Turn your Wordpress website into an event/show/concert-driven website.

== Description ==

This plugin is aimed at theme developers. It gives you the core-functionality needed for websites of theatres, stages or performers. 

After installations the functionality can easily be extend using other frameworks (eg. the [Pods Framework](http://pods.io/)).

__Compatibility__

The Theatre plugin is kept as simple as possible so it can be used for a wide variety of event websites. 

__What is included__

* Admin screens for seasons, productions and events.
* Default templates for productions.
* Short codes for listings of productions and events (wip).
* Widgets (wip)

__What is not included__

A lot! But most really cool things can easily be achieved by combining the Theatre plugin with other popular plugins:

* Caching - use [W3 Total Cache](http://wordpress.org/plugins/w3-total-cache/)
* Fancy admin screens with extra fields - use [Pods Framework](http://pods.io/) and [Tabify Edit Screen](http://wordpress.org/plugins/tabify-edit-screen/)
* Simple templating - use [Timber](http://jarednova.github.io/timber/)

__What's next?__
